# LabMotus

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 14, 2021
 * Where: Online via Discord
   
## Process - Reflection

#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

 * **[Github Projects](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2021/team-project-4-labmotus/projects/1)**

    * People were able to claim issues so everybody would know what people were working on. This way there wouldn’t be duplicate code. We could also easily see how much work we had left to do based on the number of issues. We also felt satisfaction as we can see a visualization of our progress in the project based on how many issues are closed.
 * **Weekly Meetings with Victor, Our Partner**

    * By having weekly meetings, we were able to update our partner frequently with our process. This way, we could easily make small tweaks if he asked and avoid making huge changes to our codebase. 
 * **Fixed Team Meetings on Sundays**

    * By having weekly meetings at a fixed time every week, we saved lots of time figuring out everyone’s schedule every week. Holding them on Sunday also gave us time to prepare questions or demos for our meeting with Victor on Wednesday. The weekly checkups with how everybody was doing also kept us grounded throughout the project.
 * **Discord to Communicate**

    * We decided to use Discord to communicate. This turned out to be a good decision. Different channels were delegated to different topics, which helped with organization. When calling, the screenshare function meant we could help each other debug. We also had Discord webhooks that gave updates about CircleCI and Github commits. Some members found it helpful as it reminded them to contribute and provided updates on project progress. Finally, the ability to pin messages meant important information wouldn’t get lost in the chat.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * **Division of Tasks**
    * In [Deliverable 1](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2021/team-project-4-labmotus/blob/main/deliverable-1/planning.md#q6-what-are-the-roles--responsibilities-on-the-team), when dividing tasks, we focused on who would do front-end and back-end etc. We ended up not following this as people became busy and the tasks were divided depending on which issue they took. We should’ve divided more based on clinician portal versus patient app because everybody was working on the patient app at first and we had to try and finish the clinician portal in the last few days. Although the two shared some components we should’ve divided the work more evenly among us. 
 * **Conflict Resolution**
    * In [Deliverable 1](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2021/team-project-4-labmotus/blob/main/deliverable-1/planning.md#q9-what-are-the-rules-regarding-how-your-team-works), we were very vague when we described how we would resolve conflicts such as teammates missing meetings and not doing work. We wrote that “we” would do things to keep everyone in the loop and ask a teammate what was happening, but nobody actually took the initiative. Reasons no one reached out included people being afraid of angering others, coming off as too bossy, or they are being accusatory instead of just trying to check in on others.
 * **Letting Everyone Choose [Issues](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2021/team-project-4-labmotus/issues)**
    * Our team made this decision because we wanted to have more freedom to choose tasks that interested us. But this became an “issue” (haha) when some people took too many while others didn’t take enough. There was nobody enforcing issues to be taken, so some issues were left untaken for several days. Issues also ended up being added on the fly as they were being done. We should’ve delegated the number of issues each person takes more evenly and discussed it during our team meetings as well.

#### Q3. Planned changes

 * **Assigning Issues**
    * To combat the problem of letting everyone choose their own issues, we plan on delegating some of our weekly meeting time to assign issues. We’ll go through each assigned issue and let volunteers take them. If someone has done a lot of work recently, they can relax a little. On the other hand, if a teammate hasn't done as much work, we’ll give them a chance to take issues first.
 * **Check-in on Progress**
    * In the future, we plan to check in more on progress with teammates and make sure they know what’s happening. While working on Deliverable 2, we found that some teammates would have trouble with running the app as they were not as familiar with the technologies. We plan on taking initiative to ask what’s going on because they might be afraid to ask for help. We want to reinforce the fact that nobody should be afraid to ask for help :)
 * **Time Management**
    * We plan on managing our time better by working on the project frequently instead of doing it all within the last few days before it’s due. This way, half our time isn’t spent debugging instead of working.
 * **Missing Meetings**
    * Regardless of what reason (catching up with work, waking up late, personal problems etc) for missing meetings or doing work, we will let the others know. We found that some members were frequently missing meetings but not giving a heads up, leaving us wondering where they went. If they’re too busy, we can take over their tasks to help us keep progressing.
 * **Meeting Contributions**
    * The final change we want to make is letting everybody contribute more when we have our meetings. We noticed usually only a few people lead the conversations. With the meeting being online, it’s especially hard to tell if everyone is present. Deliberately involving everyone in the conversation gives a chance for those who find it hard to speak up to share their thoughts.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
We demoed our project on March 10, 2021 via Google Meets. Aside from planning out features we wanted to complete before meetings, the demos were pretty casual. We never specifically planned out a demo presentation. We managed to demo our patient app with mock data and the partner accepted all of the features. 

He made a few change requests, such as allowing the clinician to sign up the patient, changing some of the joint names, and letting the clinician write notes on assessments that will be visible to the patient. However, some changes such as letting clinicians leave notes on assessments are a little harder to implement with the time constraint so we plan on tackling it in Deliverable 3. 

We learned that the product isn’t just about the tech side (analyzing videos, graphing joint angles, etc), but has to use correct terminology as well. Since we aren’t professional physicians it is good to have Victor guide us in the right direction.
